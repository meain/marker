marker

Markdown based presentation tool, the good parts.

This is yet another markdown based tool,
but we don't provide you an editor, text editor integration or a cli.
This is ideal when you want to to create a super simple presentation.

Sample workflow:
- You write markdown
- Host it on Github gist
- Use marker to "create" a presentation
